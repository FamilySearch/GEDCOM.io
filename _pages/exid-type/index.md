# EXID TYPE Base URIs

The FamilySearch GEDCOM 7 specification defines `EXID`.`TYPE` as holding
the URI of the authority for the identifier in the `EXID` payload.
The following table lists a number of well-known base URIs defined for this
purpose. These base URIs can be used together with the `EXID` value to form
the full URI. For a few examples, see [Migrating v5.5.1 to v7.0](../migrate/#afn-rfn-rin).

Applications can use base URIs beyond those listed in this table,
but additional URIs may not be recognized by other applications.

The set of registered EXID types in JSON format can be found in
[exid-types.json](https://github.com/FamilySearch/GEDCOM/blob/main/exid-types.json).
