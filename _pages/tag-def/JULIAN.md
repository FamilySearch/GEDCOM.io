    The Julian calendar was introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 BC and
    subsequently amended by Augustus in about 8 BC to correct an error in
    the application of its leap year rule during its first three decades.
    Years had been counted from various starting epochs during the Julian
    calendar's use; the version standardized by GEDCOM uses the same
    starting epoch as the Gregorian calendar.
    
    This calendar uses the same months as the Gregorian calendar, differing
    only in which years February has 29 days.
    
    The epoch marker BCE is permitted in this calendar; year y BCE indicates
    a year y years before year 1. Thus, there is no year 0; year 1 BCE was
    followed by year 1.
