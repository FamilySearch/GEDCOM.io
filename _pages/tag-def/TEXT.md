payload: Text

descriptions:
  - Tag abbreviated from "Text from Source"
  - A verbatim copy of any description contained within the source. This
    indicates notes or text that are actually contained in the source
    document, not the submitter's opinion about the source. This should be,
    from the evidence point of view, "what the original record keeper said"
    as opposed to the researcher's interpretation.
