descriptions:
  - Tag abbreviated from "Phone"

    A telephone number. Telephone numbers have many regional variations and
    may contain non-digit characters. Users should be encouraged to use
    internationalized telephone numbers rather than local versions. As a
    starting point for this recommendation, there are international
    standards that use a '+' shorthand for the international prefix (for
    example, in place of 011 in the US or 00 in the UK). Examples are
    +1 (555) 555-1234 (US) or +44 20 1234 1234 (UK).
    
    See ITU standards E.123 and E.164 for more information.
