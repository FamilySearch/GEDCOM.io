# How do I list two places in an emigration?

Use paired immigration/emigration events:

```
1 EMIG
2 PLAC Nice, Nice, Alpes-Maritimes, Provence-Alpes-CÃ´te d'Azur, France
3 FORM City, Arrondissement, Department, Provence, Country
2 DATE 3 MAR 1903
1 IMMI
2 PLAC Manhattan, New York,  New York, USA
3 FORM Borough, City, State, Country
2 DATE 8 MAR 1903
```

# How do I record a stillborn child?

Use a `PHRASE` under the `AGE` at death:

```
1 DEAT
2 AGE 0d
3 PHRASE Stillborn
```

# How do I record a miscarriage?

For researchers who want to include a miscarriage as a child in a family, we recommend a non-pointer `CHIL` if no details are known:

```
1 CHIL @VOID@
2 PHRASE Miscarried after 6 months
```

If there is more to say about the child, we recommend an `INDI` with `NO BIRT`:

```
0 @EX1@ INDI
1 NAME Roman /Hernandez/
1 NO BIRT
2 PHRASE Miscarried after 6 months
```

For researchers who want to record a miscarriage, but do not want to include the child in a family, we recommend a family event:

```
0 @F1@ FAM
1 WIFE @I1@
1 HUSB @I2@
1 EVEN
2 TYPE Miscarriage
2 DATE 13 JUN 1948
```

# Why can an attribute have an age?

One case is when the attribute has a clear start time; for example, educational degrees tend to be awarded at a measurable time:

```
1 EDUC Ph.D. in Computer Science
2 AGE 26y
```

Another case is when an attribute was expected to be temporary and observed at a particular time; for example, physical descriptions tend to be temporary:

```
1 DESC Mostly bald with bushy mustachios
2 AGE 38y
```

When birth date and date range of attribute are both known, `DATE` is generally better than `AGE`, but sometimes sources contain claims like "I earned my degree when I was 15" without clear dates, hence the provision of `AGE` for attributes.

# How do I record illegitimate children?

This is one of many relationship situations with many possible technical complications, the best solutions to which are being discussed for possible revision in subsequent versions of FamilySearch GECDOM.

At present, the best available tool is `INDI.FAMC.PEDI`, one for each family:

```
0 @I1@ INDI
1 FAMC @F1@
2 PEDI BIRTH
3 PHRASE Illegitimate child
1 FAMC @F2@
2 PEDI BIRTH
3 PHRASE Born into this family, but not the father's own
```

Because the nature of `BIRTH` is unclear (is it about the biological progenitors of the child or the social family unit into which it is born?) and a topic some researchers have strong feelings about, either or both of the above may be recorded `PEDI OTHER` instead of `PEDI BIRTH` by some researchers.

# How do I provide a source citaton for a parent-child relationship?

Neither the `FAMC` structure of an individual record nor the `CHIL` structure of a family record supports
having a `SOUR` citation as a substructure.  Today applications often put the `SOUR` directly under the
individual record or the family record, where it lacks specificity in terms of which family or individual
it applies to.

To maintain specificity, the best place to put the `SOUR` citation today is under an `INDI.BIRT`
as in the following example:

```
0 @I1@ INDI
1 BIRT
2 SOUR @S2@
2 FAMC @F3@
```

# How do I mark a parent-child relationship as confidential?

The standard `RESN` tag is used to mark data confidential but it is not a substructure under the `FAM.FAMC` or `FAM.CHIL` tags. You can implement a custom extension tag, perhaps `_RESN`, and add a `SCHMA` entry to indicate the extension has the same meaning as `RESN`:

```
0 HEAD
1 SCHMA
2 TAG _RESN https://gedcom.io/terms/v7/RESN
0 @I2@ INDI
1 FAMC @F3@
2 _RESN CONFIDENTIAL
0 @F3@ FAM
1 CHIL @I2@
2 _RESN CONFIDENTIAL
```

Note that with all confidential communications, it is important not only to mark the data as confidential but also to ensure that the recipient of the data understands in what cases they are to remove the confidential data and agrees to do so. `_RESN` communicates the confidential nature, but does not enforce the desired behavior.

# How do I choose LANG payloads?

If you know the GEDCOM 5.5.1 language name, [FHISO has a look-up table](https://github.com/fhiso/legacy-format/blob/master/languages.tsv). You can also look at the lists embedded in the reference 5.5.1-to-7.0 converter program.

If you know the language you want, [r12a has a very flexible search function](https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/).

You can also look through the [IANA registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry) manually and assemble the appropriate tags as outlined in [BCP 47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47), though that's something of an expert-mode approach.

# How do I record the sex of an intersex person?

The enumerated value on the `SEX` tag in GEDCOM 7.0 was amended to include "X" to describe [intersex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex) individuals:

```
0 @I1@ INDI
1 SEX X
```

Birth records in some jurisdictions use intersex as the sex value for a child who does not conform to the traditional biological definitions of male or female at birth.

The `SEX` tag is only for anatomical or biological sex at birth. For any related concept that might change and/or manifest later in life, an individual attribute should be used instead.

# How do I record polygamous families?

A `FAM` record should be used for each couple procreating or rearing offspring.
This may result in many `FAM` records for one social family unit.

A `FAM` record may also be used to represent the social family unit.
If it is desirable that all the spouses appear structurally equal, they may be linked using `ASSO` pointers with `ROLE SPOU` instead of `HUSB` and `WIFE` pointers.

Some applications may have more complete handling of `HUSB` and `WIFE` than they have for `ASSO`.

# How do I record a date without a year?

All dates in the `DateValue` datatype must have a year. Thus, you cannot use yearless dates as `DateValue`s.

However, you can add any date information as a `PHRASE`:

```
2 DATE
3 PHRASE March 3rd (year unknown)
```

You might also consider bounding the year if possible:

```
2 DATE BET 1820 AND 1840
3 PHRASE March 3rd (year unknown)
```

# How do I link to individual structures within a FamilySearch GEDCOM file?

Inside a GEDCOM file, pointers do this using the cross-reference identifiers. However, cross-reference identifiers are *not* durable across import-export cycles and should not be used outside of a GEDCOM file.

If you wish to reference a part of a FamilySearch GEDCOM file from outside that file, you should use one of the durable identifier structures: `UID`, `REFN`, or `EXID`. There is currently no standard way to do this, so any implementation will need to decide how the links will be navigated. 

# How do I flag a primary or profile photo?

There is not standard tag for this purpose in version 7.0.
The first [MULTIMEDIA_LINK](https://gedcom.io/specifications/FamilySearchGEDCOMv7.html#MULTIMEDIA_LINK) in a structure
is the "most-preferred" external object, but that does not necessarily mean it is either an image or a profile image.

As noted in the specification,

> The order of substructures of a single type indicates user preference, with the first substructure being the most-preferred value, unless a different meaning is explicitly indicated in the structure's definition.

The only "different meaning" in the current draft is for `FAM`.`CHIL`, where the specification says

> The order of the CHIL (children) pointers within a FAM (family) structure should be chronological by birth; this is an exception to the usual "most preferred value first" rule.

# How do I record nicknames?

Use the `NICK` part type under the [PERSONAL_NAME_STRUCTURE](https://gedcom.io/specifications/FamilySearchGEDCOMv7.html#PERSONAL_NAME_STRUCTURE):

```
1 NAME Bill /Miller/
2 NICK Bill
2 SURN Miller
```

The name type `AKA` can also be used to indicate that a `NAME` structure is not the primary name.

```
1 NAME William /Miller/
2 GIVN William
2 SURN Miller
1 NAME Bill /Miller/
2 TYPE AKA
2 NICK Bill
2 SURN Miller
```

It is also possible to presented the nickname inline with the other name parts:

```
1 NAME William "Bill" /Miller/
2 GIVN William
2 NICK Bill
2 SURN Miller
```

# How do I record a preferred name among given names?

In many customs a person is given a series of given names, where one of them (often not the first one)
is the name the individual will commonly be known by.

For example, the Wikipedia entry for [German name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_name) explains:

> It is common to give a child several given names, one of them intended for everyday use and known as
> the "Rufname" ("appellation name" or "call name").  This _Rufname_ is often underlined on official documents,
> as it is sometimes the second or third name in the sequence of given names on official record,
> even though it is the given name in daily use from childhood.

FamilySearch GEDCOM 7.0 and earlier GEDCOM versions including 5.5.1 do not explicitly define a standard way
to denote this concept, and so a variety of mechanisms have been used by implementations over time.  For example,
for the name "Amalie <u>Emmy</u> Noether", some implementations might use an extension tag such as `_RUFNAME`:

```
1 NAME Amalie Emmy /Noether/
2 GIVN Amalie Emmy
2 _RUFNAME Emmy
2 SURN Noether
```

Such extensions can, however, result in loss of data since they are not standardized and so can be dropped
by other implementations.  A more interoperable form using only standard tags is:

```
1 NAME Emmy /Noether/
2 GIVN Emmy
2 SURN Noether
1 NAME Amalie Emmy /Noether/
2 TYPE birth
2 GIVN Amalie Emmy
2 SURN Noether
```

The above example denotes that the second form is the actual birth name, but the first form was also used by
the person.  Although the specification does not define any semantics to the order among NAME structures,
some implementations are known to infer that the first NAME occuring is a "preferred" one to use
for display.
