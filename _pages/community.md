## Public GEDCOM Repository

Become a GitHub GEDCOM Contributor for the next version by contributing to the [FamilySearch GEDCOM Specification](https://github.com/familysearch/GEDCOM) public repository.

## Public GEDCOM.io Website Repository

Become a GEDCOM.io website contributor by contributing to the [GEDCOM.io](https://github.com/familysearch/GEDCOM.io) public repository.

## Public GEDCOM-registries Repository

Now that we have a documented [YAML format](https://gedcom.io/terms/format) we have created a useful
[extension registry](https://github.com/familysearch/GEDCOM-registries).
The community is allowed the submissions of YAML files for extensions to a common repository where they may be easily located. In addition to general interoperability gains, this will assist in an extension-to-standard workflow and in defining additional calendars and events.

## Issue Tracker 

You can review [issues being discussed](https://github.com/FamilySearch/GEDCOM/issues) for the working version of FamilySearch GEDCOM.

## Project Teams

If you would like additional information or request to participate in one or more of the following Project Teams, send an email to <GEDCOM@familysearch.org> putting "Project Team: team name(s)" in the subject.

### Active Project Teams

- **Names** - This project has been created to develop the `PERSONAL_NAME_STRUCTURE`, with aims of supporting a much wider range of human names and of supporting applications that process them. The GEDCOM 5.5.1 standard defined a `PERSONAL_NAME_STRUCTURE`. This was refined slightly in FamilySearch GEDCOM 7.0. It works well for most North-American and some European names, but it unable to properly represent names from many other cultures.

  Join the GEDCOM Name Project by going to the [GEDCOM-name](https://github.com/fisharebest/gedcom-name) public repository.

- **Citations** - This project has been created to develop the ability to reliably capture and exchange EE-style citations, Chicago-style citations, or an agreed subset of both.

  Join the GEDCOM Citations Project by going to the [GEDCOM-citations](https://github.com/dthaler/gedcom-citations) public repository.

### Future Project Teams

- **Places** - consider changing from a comma-separated place hierarchy to a set of linked place records.
- **Relationships** - support for varying definitions of families, roles and relationships.
- **Hypothesis** - sharing and collaborating on supposition of facts not yet provable with source records.
- **Sources** - more source-centric capabilities including multi-person events and multi-purpose sources.
- **DNA** - how to represent DNA information.

## Additional Areas of Participation

- **Tools** - identify software tools, sample code and sample files that will be helpful to create and upgrade FamilySearch GEDCOM processing.
- **Guides** - author and/or maintain FAQs, best practices, reference implementation guides, and other information that will be helpful to software developers.
- **Sample Files** -  is a sub-area of work that will benefit Tools, Guides, and Development.
