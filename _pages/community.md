## Public GEDCOM-name Repository

This project has been created to develop the PERSONAL_NAME_STRUCTURE, with aims of supporting a much wider range of human names and of supporting applications that process them. The GEDCOM 5.5.1 standard defined a PERSONAL_NAME_STRUCTURE. This was refined slightly in GEDCOM 7.0. It works well for most North-American and some European names, but it unable to properly represent names from many other cultures.

## Public GEDCOM-registries Repository

Now that we have a documented [YAML format](https://gedcom.io/terms/format) we have created a useful extension registry. The community is allowed the submissions of YAML files for extensions to a common repository where they may be easily located. In addition to general interoperability gains, this will assist in an extension-to-standard workflow and in defining additional calendars and events.
